# Social-Media-Business-Extractor

Social Media Business Extractor is a web-based application designed to help businesses filter and extract social media-related data based on location, business type, and platform. It allows users to dynamically select or enter criteria such as country, city, business type, and platform (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook). The app then displays a list of matching business profiles with key information such as username, platform, location, and active status. This tool is useful for market analysis, lead generation, and business research.
